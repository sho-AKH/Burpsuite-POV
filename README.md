# Burpsuite-POV
My POV of burpsuite while getting the hang of it and gradually leveling up hands on skills, for now i can only open up the software and then look for guides and google stuff in order to use it.

i can define burpsuite as a must for Security testing (web), as it's pre-built features makes it easier for a veteran to tear down a specific target and locate 
in-deep vulnerabilities and access points that might be a good starting point for an attacker. 
Can't say i am a veteran or expert of some sort but i am indeed a quick learner and can grasp technical concepts at ease 
so from now going forward i will try and enhance my current arsenal of knowledge and share my thoughts and my POV .
